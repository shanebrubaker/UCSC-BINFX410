# Big Data Bioinformatics Exercises

A hands-on workshop teaching big data processing patterns through bioinformatics (FASTQ file analysis). All exercises run locally with zero cloud costs.

**Duration:** 4-5 hours (can be split across 2-3 sessions)

## Session Breakdown

- **Session 1 (~2 hours):** Parts 0-5 — Foundations (setup, memory efficiency, chunking, parallel processing, indexing, streaming)
- **Session 2 (~2 hours):** Parts 6-9 — Advanced Patterns (MapReduce, tool integration, profiling, paired-end)
- **Session 3 / Homework:** Part 10 — Final Project (60+ min)

## Quick Start

### Option A: Conda (recommended, includes bioinformatics tools)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate binfx410-bigdata
jupyter notebook BigData_Bioinformatics_Exercises.ipynb
```

### Option B: pip (Python-only exercises)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook BigData_Bioinformatics_Exercises.ipynb
```

> Note: Option B skips `seqkit` and `fastp` integration (Part 7). Those exercises will detect missing tools and provide install instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Basic Python knowledge (functions, loops, file I/O)
- No bioinformatics background required (FASTQ format is introduced in Part 0)

## What You'll Learn

| Part | Topic | Key Concept |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Setup & Data Generation | FASTQ format, test data creation |
| 1 | Memory Efficiency | Generators vs. lists, `sys.getsizeof` |
| 2 | Chunked Processing | Processing files in fixed-size batches |
| 3 | Parallel Processing | `multiprocessing.Pool`, speedup measurement |
| 4 | Indexing & Random Access | Building file indexes for O(1) lookup |
| 5 | Streaming Pipelines | Composable generator chains |
| 6 | MapReduce Pattern | Map, shuffle, reduce phases |
| 7 | Tool Integration | Calling `seqkit`/`fastp` from Python |
| 8 | Profiling & Optimization | `time.perf_counter`, memory profiling |
| 9 | Paired-End Processing | Synchronized dual-file iteration |
| 10 | Final Project | Combine all techniques end-to-end |

## Data

All data files are generated by Part 0 of the notebook — no downloads needed. Files are created in `data/` and include:

- `sample.fastq` — 10,000 reads (standard quality)
- `large_sample.fastq` — 100,000 reads (for benchmarking)
- `mixed_quality.fastq` — Variable quality reads
- `sample_R1.fastq` / `sample_R2.fastq` — Paired-end reads

## Solutions

Solutions are embedded in the notebook as hidden cells. Click "Show Solution" or expand the collapsed cell below each exercise to reveal the answer.
