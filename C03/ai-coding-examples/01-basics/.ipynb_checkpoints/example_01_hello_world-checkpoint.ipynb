    "\n",
    "- Claude Code provides clean, well-structured code\n",
    "- The code follows Python best practices (using `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`)\n",
    "- f-strings are used for modern string formatting\n",
    "- The code is wrapped in a `main()` function for better organization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Being too vague**: \"Write a hello world\" is less clear than specifying the language and exact behavior\n",
    "2. **Overcomplicating**: Start simple and iterate\n",
    "3. **Not testing**: Always run the generated code to verify it works"
